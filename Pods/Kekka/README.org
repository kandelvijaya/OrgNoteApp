** Implemented Features
*** Result<T>
    - Abstraction on types that can fail (Contextual types i.e Network result)
    - provides `map` and `flatMap` (i.e. `bind`)
*** Future<T>
    - Abstraction over async tasks and nested callbacks (i.e. animation,
      networking, reading file)
    - provides `map`(i.e. `then`)  and `flatMap` (i.e `bind`)
** To be implemented 
*** IO
    - Abstraction over impure compuatation (capturing side effects)
*** Network<T>
    - Wrapper over IO<T> and Future<T> enabling easy networking code
** Contribution Policy
   - Syntatic sugar and fancy extension without fundamental proof are not what
     this minimalistic library strives for
   - Else, feel free to create issue or pull request.
