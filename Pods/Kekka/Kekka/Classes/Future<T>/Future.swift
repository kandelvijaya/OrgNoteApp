     `bind` is equivalent to `>>=`. It makes Promises Monadic.
     Similar to `flatMap` on Result<T> or Optional<T>, `bind` is implemented in terms of `then` and `join`.
     - note: If you want to perfrom synchronous task with the eventual value then prefer `then`

     - example:-
     ```
     Network(url).get().then { data -> ZResult<String> in
         print("Step 1")
         return data.bind(dataToString)
     }.then { str -> () in
         print("printing step 2")
         print(str.bind(takeFirstLine))
     }.bind { _ -> Promise<ZResult<Data>> in
         print("Step 3: Another task")
         return Network(url2).get()
     }.then { result -> () in
         print("Step 4 printing")
         print(result.bind(dataToString).bind(takeFirst20Chars))
     }.execute()
     ```
